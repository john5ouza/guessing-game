# Guessing Game

This project is a simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game presents a user interface where the player is prompted to guess a number between 0 and 10. The user interface consists of two screens.

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, where a random number between 0 and 10 is generated as the target number. The user's input is compared to this target number, and if they guess correctly, they are shown Screen 02 with a congratulatory message. If the user guesses incorrectly, they can continue guessing until they get it right.

The styling of the game is done using CSS to create a clean and visually appealing user interface. Fonts are imported from Google Fonts to enhance the design.

Overall, this project serves as a fun and interactive way for users to practice their guessing skills while learning the basics of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
